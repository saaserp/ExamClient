                         Release Notes

INTRODUCTION:

Betwixt provides a flexible way to map beans into XML - and vice versa. Betwixt
requires Java 1.3 or higher.

Betwixt is an open source library developed by the Jakarta Project of the 
Apache Software Foundation (see http://jakarta.apache.org/) and released under the 
Apache License 2.0 (see License.txt). Jakarta commons is an open development community. 
All are invited to contribute by joining us on the mailing lists

through http://issues.apache.org.

Betwixt 0.8 is a feature release. Support for polymorphic mappings has been improved. 
More flexible mapping are possible using new strategies. Enhancements have been made 
to mapping formats. Mixed collections are now handled more completely.

Betwixt 0.8 is compatible with 0.7.

For more details, see the detailed change log contained in docs/tasks.html.

FEATURES           
 * Added strategies for suppression of attributes and elements at introspection time.
 * Improved support for natural polymorphic mappings of collection subclasses.
 * Added support for option inheritance between parent and target mappings. Issue BETWIXT-45 
   (#37542).
 * Added getInheritedOption method to Context to assist with inheritance amongst options.
 * Added convenience constructor to DefaultIdStoringStrategy. This makes life easier for users that want to 
   use object identity (rather than equality) when generating IDs.
 * Added support for text and options into multi-mappings.
 * Improved support for subclasses of Java collective types by factoring collective type recognition into 
   strategy.
 * Added support for multiple contained polymorphic mappings.
 * Added transcription strategy to allow flexbility for schema type names.
 * Added package name property suppression strategy and make default property suppression strategy 
   public nest so that it can be subclassed.
 * Made intitial indent level used for pretty printing configurable.
 * Added guess-name attribute to addDefaults element in dot betwixt file. This allows mixed collections to 
   be used with add-adders and addDefaults.


FIXES
 * Fixed TextRule content bug. Issue BETWIXT-31 (#36930).
 * Fixed attribute ID name recognition bug. Issue BETWIXT-15 (#36929). 
 * Fixed bug when introspecting in secure environments.
 * Fixed formatting bug when pretty printing elements with endTagForEmptyElement is true.
 * Fixed map custom updater in dot betwixt file bug.
 * EOL in pretty printed xml now defaults to platform line separator.
 * Added ValueSuppressionStrategy.suppressElement to allow elements to be suppressed on the basis 
   of the value of the property. Useful for Hibernate users.
 * Added forceAccessible to element tag in dot betwixt file. This allows updater methods to be found that
   are not public.
 
DEPRECATIONS
 * IdStoringStrategy.DEFAULT should never have been a constanr since the implementation uses instance 
   variables. Using this constant will result in a memory leak. Note: use proper factory methods rather than 
   public constant fields in the future!
 * ElementRule added forceAccessible attribute and configureDescriptor replaced by private method 
    with extra parameter
