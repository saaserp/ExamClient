                          Commons Discovery Package
                                Version 0.4
                               Release Notes


INTRODUCTION
============

This is a minor bugfix and maintenance release. A few small features have been added.
New projects are encouraged to use this release of discovery.

The previous release of Commons Discovery was 0.2. The 0.3 release failed to happen, 
though an SVN tag was created. Thus a version number of 0.4 is being used for this 
release.

IMPORTANT NOTES
===============
* The jakarta commons project has migrated to the Subversion version control system
  (previously, CVS was used). Please see the jakarta commons
  website for details (http://jakarta.apache.org/commons).

* This release is done under the Apache Public License version 2.0; the
  previous release was under the APL 1.1. All files have been updated with
  the new license terms (including many files formerly missing license text).

Dependencies
=============
Commons Discovery depends on Commons Logging. It is built against version 1.0.4.

NEW FEATURES
=============
* maven build process improved
* documentation moved from raw html format to xdoc format
  (best-practices.html, adc-guidelines.html)

FILES CHANGED
=============
* tools/ManagedProperties.java
   --> fix NullPointerException in setProperty method.
   --> added logging facilities to the class; debug output can now be
       enabled if desired.
   --> Hide SecurityException in getParent(ClassLoader)
   --> Uses new JDKTools.getSystemProperty(String)

* log/SimpleLog.java
   --> if exception occurs on System.getProperty, use a default instead
     of throwing an exception.

* ResourceNameIterator.java
   --> javadoc improvements only

* resource/names/DiscoverNamesInManagedProperties.java
  resource/names/DiscoverNamesInFile.java
   -->Generalize qualification of resource/file-names by prefix/suffix;
      add new constructors that take prefix and suffix strings
      for the resource to be located.

* resource/names/DiscoverServiceNames.java
   -->Generalize qualification of resource/file-names by prefix/suffix.

* resource/ResourceDiscoverImpl.java
   -->Defer creation of ClassLoaders until we need them, and create a
      useful default [non-null].

* resource/DiscoverResources:
   --> fix to compile under JDK1.5 (don't use reserved word "enum")

* jdk/JDKHooks:
   --> New getSystemProperty method added.

* jdk/JDK12Hooks
   --> AXIS-1227:
       Added a try/catch for RuntimeExceptions in JDK12Hooks to avoid 
       NullPointerExceptions from JBoss' UnifiedClassLoader.  Reloading
       the Axis webapp after a redepoy of service classes then allows
       things to work normally.
   --> made class public (formerly, was package-scope only)
       In newer JVM/compilers, runtime complains when we try to invoke 
       setLog on a non-public class.
   --> AXIS-2145:
       Checks that it has the security permission to create a new 
       classloader.
   --> New getSystemProperty method added.

* jdk/JDK11Hooks 
   --> made class public (formerly, was package-scope only)
       In newer JVM/compilers, runtime complains when we try to invoke 
       setLog on a non-public class.
   --> New getSystemProperty method added.
